# ATP/WTA Player Performance in Wins and Losses in the 2023 Season

Certain players have certain skills that impact winning more than others. John Isner and Serena Williams are renowned as some of the greatest (if not the best) servers of all-time, while, Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek currently dominate the game with their returning prowess. What kind of factors can they control for in order to impact winning more than others? Improving first serve percentage? Winning more second serve points? This shiny application displays the statistical output in every single ATP and WTA players' match from the 2023 Season.

## This can be extremely useful in two ways:
- In terms of player evaluation, you can see what a player can control and thrive (or improve) on - in order to find more success based on their performance in wins and losses.
- In terms of opponent evaluation, you can see what an opponent may struggle with - and attack that - or what you may want to minimize (the things an opponent excels at). 

## Important note: Every single match is different
- While a player may find success in one match there are many other factors to take account of like surface, weather, and his opponent's form.
- Players like Ugo Humbert and Ben Shelton began last season aroung 100 in the world, and both ended the year in the top 20.
- Based on the 2023 season, the sample size for a season's performance (especially with certain filters like surface) players may not indicate their true abilities.
- More data would be needed in order represent their true distribution.
